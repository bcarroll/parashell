Parallel Port Control Made Easy

parashell is a Parallel Port interface for Linux and Windows.

Under Linux parashell allows the control of multiple Parallel Ports through simple command line arguments.

Under Windows parashell allows reading and writing of the CONTROL, DATA, and STATUS bytes on the default parallel port (usually 0x378)

pin is also included for Linux, which reads the status of a parallel port.
(ie., you can use the parallel port as an input device)

The simplicity of these programs make it very easy to use a Parallel Port to control stepper motors, Relays, LEDs, etc...
